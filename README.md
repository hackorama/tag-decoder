Tag Decoder
====================

Archiving the code remains of [Mytago](http://techcrunch.com/2006/05/20/mytago-a-realonline-world-bridge/) tag system project from 2006.
Developed for J2ME/Symbian phones and was obsoleted by the smart phone era with better camera and processing power.


This is the C++ version of the tag decoder code that runs on server side.
